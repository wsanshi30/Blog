#  About me

My name is Tao Wang, and I am from Anhui. Under the guidance of [Assoc. Prof. Jianmin, Zeng](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/info/1035/1478.htm), I earned my Master's degree in [Psychology from Southwest University](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/#). Throughout my graduate studies, Professor Zeng's guidance was instrumental. I 
had the opportunity to collaborate with esteemed researchers such as [Weijie Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weijie-Huang-9) and [Li Su](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li-Su-10), leading 
to our publication, "Right thalamic volume mediates impact of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene on the endowment effect" in the well-regarded journal, *Behavioural Brain Research* [JCR: **Q2**; CiteScore: **Q2**]. Additionally, I developed proficiency in advanced research techniques including meta-analysis, which enabled me to publish a paper titled "Social decision-making in major depressive disorder: A three-level meta-analysis", in the *Journal of Psychiatric Research* [JCR: **Q1**; CiteScore: **Q1**]."

**My research interest includes:**
- Decision-making
- Behavioural economics
- Neuroeconomics
- Mental disorders
- Meta-analysis

- **Brief Introduction:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is frequently associated with social dysfunction and impaired decision-making, but its impact on social decisions remains unclear. Our meta-analytic study reveals that MDD significantly impacts social decision-making, manifesting as reduced trust and increased cooperation, with these effects moderated by demographic and treatment variables. These findings emphasize the necessity for tailored therapeutic approaches that consider individual differences in age, education, and treatment coverage, to enhance social functionality and outcomes for MDD patients.

- **Brief Introduction:** Adaptive behavior in human through our live course is a direct result of the brain, but emerging evidence suggests that genes also introduce bias in behavior. Here, we showed that the interplay between thalamus and dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene jointly determined the endowment effect.

- **Brief Introduction:** Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) frequently engage in risky behaviors, such as self-harm and suicide, but its effect on risky economic decision-making remains unclear. Our study found that MDD patients perform differently across tasks: they select disadvantageous decks in the Iowa Gambling Task, make fewer pumps on the Balloon Analog Risk Task, and perform similarly to healthy controls in the Cambridge Gambling Task and the Game of Dice Task. These findings reveal how MDD influences economic decisions, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to mitigate risky behaviors.

- Brief Introduction: Advertisements (ads) are intended to increase individuals' willingness to purchase and are usually expensive; thus, it would be counterproductive if an ad element actually decreased willingness to purchase. However, our study revealed that advertising signs on online shopping platforms decrease consumers' willingness to purchase, recommend, or click on products. These findings underscore the importance of understanding consumer psychology and suggest reevaluating the use of ad signs to avoid counterproductive effects in online advertising strategies.
