My name is ***Tao Wang***, and I am originally from ***Anhui, China***. Under the guidance of [***Professor Jianmin Zeng***](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/info/1035/1478.htm), I earned my Master's degree in [***Psychology from Southwest University***](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/#). Throughout my graduate studies, Professor Zeng’s mentorship played a vital role in shaping my academic development.

During this period, I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed researchers such as [***Weijie Huang***](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weijie-Huang-9) and [***Li Su***](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li-Su-10). Our collaboration resulted in the publication of the paper:

> ***"Right thalamic volume mediates impact of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene on the endowment effect"***  
> Published in *Behavioural Brain Research*  
> *[JCR: **Q2**; CiteScore: **Q2**]*

In addition, I developed strong proficiency in advanced research methodologies, particularly ***meta-analysis***. This expertise led to another publication:

> ***"Social decision-making in major depressive disorder: A three-level meta-analysis"***  
> Published in *Journal of Psychiatric Research*  
> *[JCR: **Q1**; CiteScore: **Q1**]*

## Research Interests
